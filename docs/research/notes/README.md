# Research Notes

Quick notes and observations as you work. Keep it simple!

## Basic Structure

- `daily/` - Today's notes and tasks
- `ideas/` - Random thoughts and concepts
- `refs/` - Useful links and references
- `downloads/` - Files and data from Anthropic

## Quick Start

1. Create a new file in `daily/` for today's date
2. Dump your notes, links, and thoughts
3. Move anything important to the main docs when ready

No need to overthink it - just capture what's useful!
